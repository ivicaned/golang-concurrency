# golang-concurrency
This is simple Golang concurrency example.
We have list of websites from which we try to get responses(concurrently), and just print those that are working fine, 
and inform user about websites that ar not accessible.
Code can be improved, also we could try to increase number of logical processors and benchmark in real life scenario, 
but this is just example scenario.
